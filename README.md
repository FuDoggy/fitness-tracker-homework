# HOMEWORK #14 - FITNESS TRACKER

This fitness tracker application is designed for the purpose of tracking daily workouts and being able to view a dashboard summarizing the user's weekly workouts.

## USAGE

The user will be able to create and track resistance and cardio workouts.  These workouts will be saved and used to display a tracking summary, outlining distance covered, resistance lifted, among other stats.  For example, the user will be able to log a workout for a given day.  The user can enter the workout type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of each exercise.  Once the user's workout is posted, they will be able to click on the fitness tracker dashboard in order to view their summary,
distance traveled, along with the other statistics applicable to their workouts.

## AUTHORS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
